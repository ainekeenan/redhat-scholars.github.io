This tutorial provides you with a super-simple CRUD microservice (in two flavors: Spring Boot and Quarkus), FruitService, that implements the usual functions: create, update, delete, find all, etc. mapped to a table in a relational database.

No need to code this time, the Java code is simple, it works and we have tested it against, H2, PostgreSQL and Oracle RDBMS. +

What you will learn:

* Deploy the code against PostgreSQL directly from the command line using the JKube maven plugin
* You will also learn how JKube leverages Source to Image (S2I) to speed up the process of building container images inside OpenShift.
* You'll find out how to do the same for Quarkus but this time using the Quarkus OpenShift plugin instead of JKube
* We will show you how to use Telepresence to speed up development iterations.
* Finally you'll learn how to enable Remote Development Mode for your Quarkus project
