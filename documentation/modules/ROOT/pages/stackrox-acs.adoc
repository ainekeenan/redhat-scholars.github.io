Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (or ACS) provides the tools and capabilities to address the security needs of a cloud-native development approach on Kubernetes.

The ACS solution offers visibility into the security of your cluster, vulnerability management, and security compliance through auditing, network segmentation awareness and configuration, security risk profiling, security-related configuration management, threat detection, and incident response. In addition, ACS grants an ability to pull the actions from that tooling deep into the application code development process through APIs. +
