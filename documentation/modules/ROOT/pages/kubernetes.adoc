Don’t be the last one to board the Kubernetes train! Even if you’re not deploying apps to Kubernetes now, you might be soon. So hurry up, take this deep dive with us, and learn from recognized CodeCasters about the fundamentals of Kubernetes.
Be prepared to interact with other attendees and the instructor on this journey that includes the open hybrid cloud, Kubernetes, tooling, terminology, concepts, and practical exercises of how you can apply, deploy, and use Kubernetes to fulfill your cloud-native requirements.
